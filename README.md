Website with various report generation and file conversion tools. 

This includes:

- an annotation/comment report generator, which extracts comments from either a PDF (.pdf) or Word (.docx) document,
  and compiles them into a report where the comments are grouped by page.
- a document summary report generator, which takes two files (both PDF or both Word) and compares their contents. The
  generated report is a Word document which contains text, with the highlighted portions being the differences/changes.
- both a converter for converting PDF documents to Word documents and a converter for converting Word documents to PDF
  documents
